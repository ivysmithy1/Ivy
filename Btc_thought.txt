Bitcoin (BTC) – Portfolio Thoughts & Strategy

Current Status:
- BTC is trading around $61,000–$63,000
- Strong recovery since the April 2024 halving
- Market sentiment is cautiously bullish but cooling down after the Q2 rally

Current Holdings:
- No BTC currently held
- Watching closely for potential re-entry

Reasons I Respect BTC (Even Without Holding):
1. 🏦 It's the macro asset of crypto — digital gold
2. 🪙 Most institutions (BlackRock, Fidelity) start with BTC exposure
3. 💼 BTC sets the pace for altcoin cycles — when it moves, everything moves
4. 🔐 The most decentralized, secure, and time-tested blockchain

Why I'm Not Holding BTC Right Now:
- My portfolio is focused on growth (ETH, SOL, HYPE), and BTC moves slower
- I treat BTC like a macro indicator, not a high-yield asset
- I prefer allocating BTC-style safety to stablecoins or cash during high volatility

Possible Entry Points:
- $55K–$58K if market retraces
- If BTC dominance drops below 48% and altcoins look overheated, I may rotate into BTC

Sell/Exit Plan (if re-entered):
- Sell 25% around $75K
- Sell 50% near $85K (potential new ATH)
- Final portion held for $100K psychological level, if reached

Final Thoughts:
- BTC is not where I go for big ROI, but it’s where I go for **stability**
- It's the king of the hill — I just play around the castle
- I’ll respect BTC’s role in the market even if I don’t actively hold it
