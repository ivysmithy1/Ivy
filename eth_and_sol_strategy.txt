ETH (Ethereum) Strategy – August 2025

Current Holdings:
- ETH: 1.2
- Entry Price: $2,930

Short-Term Plan:
- Monitor price action around $3,200 resistance
- Consider adding more on dips below $2,800 if overall market remains bullish

Long-Term Outlook:
- Hold for ETH 2.0 updates and further L2 adoption (Arbitrum, Optimism)
- Target prices:
  - $3,500 → Take small profit (10%)
  - $4,000+ → Hold for bull cycle continuation

Why ETH?
- Smart contract king
- Strong developer ecosystem
- Most major DeFi + NFT projects built on ETH
- L2 growth = long-term ETH burn + demand

Risk Plan:
- Don’t overallocate beyond 35% of total portfolio
- Rebalance if BTC dominance spikes above 55% (ETH often underperforms)

SOL (Solana) Strategy – August 2025

Current Holdings:
- SOL: 30 tokens
- Entry Price: $164

Short-Term Plan:
- Watch closely for ecosystem growth (especially NFT volume and new dApps)
- Consider selling partial position at:
  - $190 → 10% sell
  - $220 → 20% sell
  - $250+ → Trail stop for remainder

Long-Term Outlook:
- Hold part of the position for possible $300+ if macro stays bullish
- Keep eyes on Firedancer progress & compression tech adoption

Why SOL?

- Gaining attention from normies and devs
- Big moves likely to come during altseason rotation

Risk Plan:
- Max 25% of portfolio in SOL
